# Jammming
**Capstone project for Codecademy**

Jammming is the final project for front-end web development in Codecademy. The initial version allows a user to search Spotify, create a new playlist, and save the playlist to Spotify. In future versions, additional functionality will be added along with documentation for each new feature.

**How to Jam with Jammming**

*Users must be logged into a Spotify account to use Jammming to create playlists. Create an account or log in at <https://www.spotify.com/>

**Step 1** - Type a search term in the box at the top of the app and press Enter or click Search.

**Step 2** - The top 20 matches will appear in the Results box. When samples of the tracks are available, audio controls will appear in the track information. Click the play/pause button in the audio player to preview up to 30 seconds of the track.

**Step 3** - To add a track to the current playlist, click the " + " button on the right end of the desired track's information.

**Step 4** - Continue searching and adding tracks as desired. 

**Step 5** - Scroll down to the Playlist box if it does not appear to the right of the search results. Double check the tracks listed. Remove any unwanted tracks by clicking the " - " button on the right end of the unwanted track's information.

**Step 6** - Rename your playlist by clicking on the title text at the top of the Playlist box. Delete the existing text, and type a name for the new playlist.

**Step 7** - Click the Save to Spotify button at the bottom of the Playlist box. The new playlist will then save to Spotify, and Jammming will reset the Results and Playlist boxes to be ready for the creation of another playlist.
